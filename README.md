# [Daily-art](https://astynax.me/racket-daily-art/index.html)

A set of small Racket programs that generate some images.

All the programs made using the [2htdp/image](https://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpimage.html) teachpack.

The demo site is built using

- Haskell+`shake` (build tool)
- `pygments` (code highlighting)
- `imagemagic` (thumbnail generation)
